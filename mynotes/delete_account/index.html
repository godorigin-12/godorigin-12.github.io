<p>Welcome to My Notes.
<br>
The data we store are user's email and notes created by user as part of app functionality.
<br>
You can request to delete either:<br>
1. All your notes and keep email so that you still have a account in our app<br>
2. Your account in which your email and all your notes will be removed from our server<br>
<br>
To request any of above you can send email to us at godorigin12@gmail.com with the type of request (1 or 2 from above) along with the email id registered in the app.<br>
<br>
We will then manually remove your data from our server and send you acknowledgement.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
GODORIGIN
